# <div id="us">z<div id="ak">A</div><div id="hi">K</div></div> **StateFace**

A font you can use in your web apps when you want tiny state shapes as a design element.

It's designed to be used at small sizes, and the shapes have been highly simplified to make for a really small font. All 50 states plus D.C. and a wee continental U.S. map fit in about 22k, and they look great on Retina displays.

At ProPublica we're using it in our [super PAC tracker](http://projects.propublica.org/pactrack).

## How to Use

The easiest way to use StateFace on the web is to use FontSquirrel's technique to serve StateFace in a reliably cross-platform way:

1. In the `font/webfont` directory, find the following files and upload them to your webserver.

        stateface-regular-webfont.eot
        stateface-regular-webfont.woff
        stateface-regular-webfont.ttf
        stateface-regular-webfont.svg

    Note: Firefox gets a bit testy about cross-domain-origin assets so it's really best to serve them from your actual webserver.

2. Include this chunk of CSS in a stylesheet that's called from your web page. Use the correct paths, of course.

        @font-face {
            font-family: 'StateFaceRegular';
            src: url('stateface-regular-webfont.eot');
            src: url('stateface-regular-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
                 url('stateface-regular-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
                 url('stateface-regular-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
                 url('stateface-regular-webfont.svg#StateFaceRegular') format('svg');
            font-weight: normal;
            font-style: normal;
        }

3. Now, any text that has or inherits the font-family 'StateFaceRegular' style will appear as a state shape. See the character reference below to know which letter will draw which state, or [download the handy json file](http://propublica.github.com/stateface/reference/stateface.json) for programmatic access.

4. As an alternative to the StateFace code, you can use the [stylesheet](reference/stateface.css) put together by [Paul Smith](https://github.com/paulsmith) to add CSS classes that correspond to a stateface's two-letter USPS abbreviation.

If you just want the OpenType font to use in a print layout you can [download it here](http://propublica.github.com/stateface/font/StateFace-Regular.otf).

## CSS Replacement

[Paul Smith](https://github.com/paulsmith) put together a [stylesheet](reference/stateface.css) that allows for css-based replacement (or prepending) of text. For example, for replacement you'd use:

        <span class="stateface stateface-replace stateface-{abbrev}">{statename}</span>

Which could produce <span class="stateface stateface-replace stateface-md">Maryland</span>

If you only want to prepend the state shape to the span you can do:

        <span class="stateface stateface-{abbrev}">{statename}</span>

So you can write sentences like: I was born in <span class="stateface stateface-co">Colorado</span> and then moved to <span class="stateface stateface-fl">Florida</span>, and graduated from high school in
<span class="stateface stateface-ca">California</span>.

There is a full demo [here](reference/cssclass.html).

[Angela Murrell](https://github.com/amurrell) wrote a [Sass](reference/stateface.scss) file you can use in your Sass projects. It compiles to this CSS [stylesheet](reference/stateface-generated.css), but you could rewrite the Sass to generate custom CSS easily.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Support for Guam is in this Sass file, but it's not yet an icon. We'll get to it soon.</p>

To use it to replace,

        <span class="sf-new-mexico sf-replace">Words, and you must have them!</span>


Many argue that <span class="sf-california sf-replace">california</span> is the best state.

To use it to prepend,

        <span class="sf-new-mexico">Words, prepended by a state icon.</span>

Let's borrow that sentence again: I was born in <span class="sf-colorado">Colorado</span> and then moved to <span class="sf-fl">Florida</span>, and graduated from high school in
<span class="sf-06">California</span>.

Here's the full range of what you can do with that great primary battleground state, <span class="sf-nh">New Hampshire:</span>

        <span class="sf-new-hampshire">Words, prepended by a state icon.</span>
        <span class="sf-nh">Words, prepended by a state icon.</span>
        <span class="sf-33">Words, prepended by a state icon.</span>
        <span class="sf-new-hampshire sf-replace">Words, and you must have them!</span>
        <span class="sf-nh sf-replace">Words, and you must have them!</span>
        <span class="sf-33 sf-replace">Words, and you must have them!</span>

## Projection Info

Each state is projected using a relevant state plane projection, and the U.S. (lowercase z) is projected using [Texas Centric Albers Equal Area](http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3083/). The source [shapefiles](https://github.com/propublica/stateface/tree/master/tools/us-states) are adapted from [Natural Earth data](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/). See Natural Earth's [terms of use](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/) for details.

## Installing via Bower

You can install and manage StateFace using [Bower](https://bower.io):

    > bower install stateface

Or, add to your `bower.json`:

    {
      "name": "my bower-powered project",
      "dependencies": {
        "stateface": "1.0.0"
      }
    }


## Forking and Contributing

The [Glyphs Mini](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/glyphs-mini/id469036911?mt=12) `.glyphs` file is [included in the repo](http://propublica.github.com/stateface/font/stateface.glyphs) if any type (especially hinting) experts want to try their hand at tuning it.

FontSquirrel's [FontFace Generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator) generated the files in `font/webfont`.

If you want to re-make the `.eps` files the `tools` directory includes a program to do so. You'll need to have [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) installed.
Running `make state-plane` or `make albers` will make a fresh copy.
